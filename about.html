                        <!-- History content -->
                        <p>The official creation of the University was in 1231 when King Henry III of England gave people the right to teach students and lower taxes. A letter from Pope Gregory IX in 1233 also gave the right to everyone who got a degree from Cambridge to teach in any place in the Christian world.
                           In 1290, Pope Nicholas IV called Cambridge a studium generale. From that point, many researchers and teachers from other European universities started to come to Cambridge to work or give lessons.</p>
